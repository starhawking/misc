# I want my old photobucket metadata too!!!
I kept getting notifications that my photobucket was inactive and would be deleted if I didn't log in. It is fairly easy to download a copy of all the images, but I wanted the upload dates and descriptions too. So I threw this together in an evening. It was also a nice project to learn how to use Selinium 

Who knows how long this will actually work, but it works now and that's something!
